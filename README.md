# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
You listen to what the customer needs and compile it into a user story, typically with the most important needs at the top.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I normally approach working on programs from the top down, but after learning about SCRUM and AGILE I will now be building parts of it before assembling it all together! it breaks down the difficult parts into smaller digestible portions and allows one to handle more stuff!
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means that you follow the practices of the Compaany, and also include detailed comments when changing or updating code for programs!
